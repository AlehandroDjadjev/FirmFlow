Update the this plan using the provided messages and extra info. You have to extract everything mentioned and with all the facts + their root ideas. Implement new steps in the plan or add to existing ones. You should not summarize the current plan in any way and shouldn't rewrite anything, if it isn't related to integrating the new ideas into the old text.
You can and should expand on the ideas, so long as they are intergrated well into the final document.
Do not add any extra messages in the plan like "New updated content" - keep ALL the original text and only INSERT new information. You are only allowed to change parts when integrating the new ideas, you shouldn't touch ANYTHING else and only return a document in the original format with NO insertions.
